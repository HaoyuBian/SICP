#|Just because a procedure is recursive, doesn’t mean the process that it generates is recursive. 
A procedure is recursive when that procedure refers to itself in order to evaluate.|#

#|In contrasting iteration and recursion, 
we must be careful not to confuse the notion of a recursive process with the notion of a recursive procedure. 
When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are referring to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers (either directly or indirectly) to the procedure itself. 
But when we describe a process as following a paern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure is wrien|#

#|一个程序是递归，并不意味着他执行的过程是递归的。在中文译本中，翻译为，递归计算过程 和 递归过程 。当我们说
`递归过程`时，论述的是一个语法形式上的事实，即调用了自己。当说某一个计算过程有某种形式的递归时（process recursive）
我们说的是这个计算过程的进展方式。有可能一个递归的程序会产生一个迭代的计算过程。
书中举例为斐波那契数列的计算方式|#
